## My process
-create a draft of the website
-organize a template and dublicate
-split each template into two main component(fig,content)
-used html and css for designing
finally java script
-add on click on the the faq questions 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Through this exercise I understood when to use the flex box and positioning syntaxes e.g:relative , absolute.

i made use of the 100vh property to properly the properties of individual card.

i am super excited to have used Java Script 

### Continued development

i have now started to learn the React js framework.I cant wait to see how this project would be
